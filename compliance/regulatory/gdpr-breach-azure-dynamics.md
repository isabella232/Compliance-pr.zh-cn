<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p101">Microsoft Azure 认真遵守《一般数据保护条例》(GDPR) 规定的义务。Microsoft Azure 采取全面的安全措施来防止数据泄露。这些措施包括物理和逻辑安全控制以及自动化安全流程、全面的信息安全和隐私策略，以及针对所有人员的安全和隐私培训。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p101">Microsoft Azure takes its obligations under the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) seriously. Microsoft Azure takes extensive security measures to protect against data breaches. These include both physical and logical security controls, as well as automated security processes, comprehensive information security and privacy policies, and security and privacy training for all personnel.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p102">安全从[安全开发生命周期](https://www.microsoft.com/sdl/)开始就内置于 Microsoft Azure 中，这是一个融合了“通过设计保护隐私”和“默认保护隐私”方法的强制性开发过程。Microsoft 的安全策略指导原则是"假定泄露"，这是深层防护策略的扩展。通过不断挑战 Azure 的安全功能，Microsoft 能够了解新兴威胁。有关 Azure 安全的详细信息，请查看这些[资源](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/security/azure-security)。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p102">Security is built into Microsoft Azure from the ground up, starting with the [Security Development Lifecycle](https://www.microsoft.com/sdl/), a mandatory development process that incorporates privacy-by-design and privacy-by-default methodologies. The guiding principle of Microsoft's security strategy is to 'assume breach,' which is an extension of the defense-in-depth strategy. By constantly challenging the security capabilities of Azure, Microsoft can stay ahead of emerging threats. For more information on Azure security, please review these [resources](https://www.microsoft.com/trustcenter/security/azure-security).</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p103">Microsoft 拥有全球性的全天候事件响应服务，努力减轻针对 Microsoft Azure 的攻击所造成的影响。Microsoft 通过了多项安全性和合规性审核 (例如 [ISO/IEC 27018](offering-iso-27018.md)) 的检验，在其数据中心使用严格的操作和流程来防止未经授权的访问，包括全天候视频监控、经过培训的安全人员、智能卡和生物识别控制。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p103">Microsoft has a global, 24x7 incident response service that works to mitigate the effects of attacks against Microsoft Azure. Attested by multiple security and compliance audits (e.g. [ISO/IEC 27018](offering-iso-27018.md)), Microsoft employs rigorous operations and processes at its data centers to prevent unauthorized access, including 24x7 video monitoring, trained security personnel, smart cards, and biometric controls.</span></span>

## <a name="detection-of-potential-breaches"></a><span data-ttu-id="9051b-114">检测潜在泄露</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-114">Detection of potential breaches</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p104">由于现代云计算的特性，客户云环境中发生的所有数据泄露并非都涉及 Microsoft Azure 服务。Microsoft 采用了 Azure 服务的共享责任模型来定义安全和操作责任。共享责任在讨论云服务的安全性时非常重要，因为云服务提供商和客户都对云安全性有部分负责。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p104">Due to the nature of modern cloud computing, not all data breaches occurring in a customer cloud environment involve Microsoft Azure services. Microsoft employs a shared responsibility model for Azure services to define security and operational accountabilities. Shared responsibility is important when discussing security of a cloud service, because both the cloud services provider and the customer are accountable for portions of cloud security.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p105">Microsoft 不会监控或响应属于客户责任范围的安全事件。仅限客户的漏洞不会作为 Azure 安全事件进行处理，将需要客户租户来管理响应工作。如果指定了适当的服务联系人，客户事件响应部门也可能会与 Microsoft Azure [客户支持](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/)部门进行协作。Microsoft Azure 还提供各种服务（例如 [Azure 安全中心](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/)），客户可以用来开发和管理安全事件响应。</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p105">Microsoft does not monitor for or respond to security incidents within the customer's realm of responsibility. A customer-only security compromise would not be processed as an Azure security incident and would require the customer tenant to manage the response effort. Customer incident response may involve collaboration with Microsoft Azure [customer support](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/), given appropriate service contracts. Microsoft Azure also offers various services (e.g., [Azure Security Center](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/security-center/)) that customers can utilize for developing and managing security incident response.</span></span>

<span data-ttu-id="9051b-p106">Azure 根据安全事件响应流程响应潜在数据泄露，该流程属于 Microsoft Azure 事件管理计划的一部分。Azure 安全事件响应使用五阶段流程来实现：检测、评估、诊断、稳定和关闭。随着调查的进展，安全事故响应团队可能在诊断和稳定阶段之间切换。安全事件响应流程概述如下：</span><span class="sxs-lookup"><span data-stu-id="9051b-p106">Azure responds to a potential data breach according to the security incident response process, which is a subset of the Microsoft Azure incident management plan. Azure's security incident response is implemented using a five-stage process: Detect, Assess, Diagnose, Stabilize, and Close. The Security Incident Response Team may alternate between the diagnose and stabilize stages as the investigation progresses. An overview of the security incident response process is below:</span></span>
